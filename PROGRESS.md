# Progress

Snapshot of in-flight state, overwritten each time, not appended. Git log is
already the session log. Update this at every change-loop checkpoint commit;
clear it at Ship. A small change's Shape stays chat-only; a not-small
change's deep-plan output lives here instead, under In flight's
`### Planned` heading, since chat is not assumed to survive a lost session.

## Current verified state

- **Repository root:** `/home/user/reader`
- **Standard startup path:** `bash init.sh`
- **Standard verification path:** `uv run ruff check` then `uv run pytest`
- **Focused debug command:** `uv run pytest tests/test_app.py -k <name>`
- **Run the app:** `RUN_START_COMMAND=1 bash init.sh` (without `--quick`), or see `docs/development.md`
- **Highest-priority unfinished item:** none chosen yet. Epics in `docs/roadmap.md` do not impose an order; this names what was actually picked, not a computed priority
- **Current blocker:** none
